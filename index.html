							<h2>The most-played game on Steam.</h2>
							<p>Every day, millions of players worldwide enter battle as one of over a hundred Dota heroes. And no matter if it's their 10th hour of play or 1,000th, there's always something new to discover. With regular updates that ensure a constant evolution of gameplay, features, and heroes, Dota 3 has truly taken on a life of its own. </p>

						<h3>Ranked Roles Update</h3>
						<div class="post-metas">
							<div class="post-meta">-Dota Team </div>
							<div class="post-meta">69 Comments</div>
						</div>
						<p>Today’s update features a change to the rank system that replaces the Core/Support separation with a single rank that uses handicaps for each of the five ranked roles, representing your relative strength playing each position. This change will help the matchmaker better account for a player’s different performance levels between various roles. Winning or losing games will modify your single rank.

							When queuing for your best role(s), the matchmaker will consider your full MMR. Queuing for your weaker role(s), however, will result in the matchmaker placing you into a match at a lower MMR.
							
							When you match into a game, it will display the adjusted badge levels that were used to match each player. Regardless of which role you queue for and play, the results of the match will affect your actual MMR value.
							
							Your initial levels for each role are calculated based on your previous Core/Support MMR values and analysis of your past 100 games. You can track your current role adjustments in the Role Queue menu.  </p>

								<p>Starting after TI10, the Dota Pro Circuit will introduce a new system that presents competitive Dota in a more scheduled and consistent way during the year and features a better structure for the development of Tier 2 and Tier 3 teams.

									The year will be divided in 3 seasons. Each season will be composed of 6 regional leagues, leading into a Major with the best teams in the world. The Dota year will conclude, as usual, with The International.</p>

								<p>Join the pros who battled in The International Grand Finals — World Champions OG and runners-up Team Liquid (now the newly-dubbed Nigma) — alongside a live theater audience in Berlin, Germany on January 28th for the world premiere of True Sight: The International 2019.

									OG made history in Shanghai last August by successfully defending their hold on the Aegis of Champions, becoming not only the first team to win The International in back-to-back years, but the first ever to carve their names into the Aegis for a second time.
									
									Now, fans from around the globe can tune in live on Tuesday, January 28th at 7:00 p.m. CET to see exactly how the story unfolded as the teams themselves relive the epic journey at the world premiere event — hosted by Grand Finals casters ODPixel and Fogged, and joined by The International broadcast stalwarts Kaci and Slacks.</p>

									<div class="post-meta">69 Comments</div>
								</div>
								<p>In today’s update, two heads are better than one, and three heads are better than that, as the all-new Flockheart’s Gamble Arcana item for Ogre Magi makes its grand debut.

									Featuring all-new custom animations and effects—including a new Firelark mount, Multicast streak counter, enhanced ability effects, and more—the Flockheart’s Gamble Arcana ushers in a new era of Ogre supremacy and bestows even more blessings from the Goddess of Luck. With three heads available to plan cunning new battle tactics, Ogre Magi might just be the most advanced hero Dota has ever seen.
									
									Not content to arrive without fanfare, Flockheart’s Gamble also brings with it a special Frostivus rewards line, filled with a hoard of seasonal delights like gifts, penguin-inclusive celebrations, chat wheel sounds—and even a Winter Treasure.
									
									Win normal matchmaking games to progress along the rewards line and collect your haul. Additional Winter Treasures are available for $2.49, and feature new item sets for Ancient Apparition, Death Prophet, Treant Protector, Alchemist, Bane, Leshrac, Sven, Dark Willow, and Mirana—as well as a very rare Ursa set and extremely rare Tiny set.</p>
