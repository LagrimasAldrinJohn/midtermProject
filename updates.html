						<h3>Dota 2 Update - March 5th, 2020</h3>
						<div class="post-metas">
							<div class="post-meta">-Valve</div>
						</div>
						<p>In this update we are introducing a new system for gathering data on the type of changes that are harder to evaluate or predict without very large number of games, such as gold bounty formula changes.

							We expect the number of times that we actually do this during the year to be very low, however when we do it it'll be during weekdays only at the lowest point of user activity, between 4 and 6PM Seattle time. In addition, we are adding a convar "dota_disable_experimental_gameplay" that can be used by players to disable it. Any gameplay changes will only be active in matchmaking games where no players have the convar set. The changes will never be active in lobby and league games.
							
							We recognize that in some cases players will back solve what changes were done, however we won't announce changes ourselves in part because we don't want players to overcompensate with knowledge of them and because generally we prefer to not reveal potential upcoming changes.
							
							Although the type of changes we are thinking about, like gold distribution, take much more than a game or two to show their full impact, we will still be able to get meaningful data and analysis on the direction and scale of changes.  </p>

								<p>- Fixed a bug with combining Bloodstone or Rapier when some components were in your backpack.
									- Fixed the interaction of backdoor protection and Lone Druid's Bear and Brewmaster's Primal Split.
									- When selling stacked wards both sentry and observer wards now restock correctly.
									- Fixed a bug where a gem stolen from the enemy team would credit the wrong player with bounty for wards killed.
									- Fixed a bug where a creep killing a ward did not award bounty gold to the player who placed the detection.
									- Fixed the interaction of Lone Druid's Spirit Bear and Magic Lamp.
									- Dark Seer's Surge and Legion Commander's Press the Attack with the AoE talents will no longer cause the caster to pivot when self-casting. </p>

								<p>We are making our smurf detection system more sensitive in this update. This change will much more proactively target potential smurf accounts, but may on rare occasion give a normal player extra MMR. </p>

								<p>- Neutral items held by Lone Druid's Spirit Bear now show as held by Lone Duid in the neutral items tab.
									- Neutral items that have been consumed now show as "Consumed" in the neutral items tab.
									- Neutral items that have been dropped on the ground outside the fountain, or are otherwise unaccounted for, are shown as "Unknown" in the neutral items tab.
									- When you open the shop, if you had the neutral items tab open last, open the basic tab instead.
									- The "Show Popular Items" button (star icon) in the shop is now a saved preference, and will not default to enabled when you start a new match.
									- Toggling the "lock combining" option on items carried by the courier will no longer cause the courier to return to base. </p>
